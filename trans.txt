of how, Trojan opulence and Trojan cries, a kingdom

could be uprooted, destroyed by the Greeks, 

and which I saw the most misery 

and which I was a great part in.

What Myrmidon or Dolopian or soldier of that cruel Ulysses

could speak of such and refrain from tears?

urges us and falling stars to sleep,

but if you so want to know us so

and to briefly hear Troy’s eulogy, our suffering

even though my mind remembering shrinks back in grief and flees,

I’ll begin. Fractured by war and driven back by Fate
